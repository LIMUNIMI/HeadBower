# Yaw Filter Alpha Control & Logarithmic Bowing Implementation

## Overview

Two new features have been implemented to improve the yaw velocity playing mode in HeadBower:

1. **Yaw Filter Alpha Control** - Real-time adjustment of head yaw smoothing (0.1 to 1.0)
2. **Logarithmic Bowing Mode** - Optional logarithmic velocity mapping for improved fine control

---

## Feature 1: Yaw Filter Alpha Control

### Purpose

The head yaw velocity is filtered for stability using an exponential moving average (EMA) filter. The alpha parameter controls how much smoothing is applied:
- **Alpha = 0.1**: Maximum smoothing (very smooth, slower response)
- **Alpha = 1.0**: No smoothing (raw velocity, instant response but noisier)
- **Default: 0.25**: Balanced smoothing

Users can now adjust this value in real-time using arrow buttons in the settings panel.

### Implementation Details

#### 1. Backend Changes

**File:** `Settings/UserSettings.cs`
- Added property `YawFilterAlpha` (range: 0.1 to 1.0, default: 0.25)
- Auto-saves to Settings.json when changed

**File:** `Modules/Rack.cs`
- Added static reference `HeadMotionCalculator` to access the preprocessor

**File:** `..\NITHlibrary\Tools\Filters\ValueFilters\DoubleFilterMAexpDecaying.cs`
- Changed `_alpha` field from readonly to mutable
- Added public method `SetAlpha(float newAlpha)` to update filter alpha at runtime

**File:** `..\NITHlibrary\Nith\Preprocessors\NithPreprocessor_HeadMotionCalculator.cs`
- Added public method `SetFilterAlpha(float newAlpha)` that updates all velocity and acceleration filters

**File:** `Modules/DefaultSetup.cs`
- Initialize HeadMotionCalculator with user's YawFilterAlpha setting
- Subscribe to PropertyChanged event for YawFilterAlpha updates
- Dynamically update filter alpha when user changes the setting

#### 2. UI Changes

**File:** `MainWindow.xaml`
- Added new control section "Yaw smoothing (0.1-1.0)" in left settings column
- Three buttons: minus (?), display (LCD border), plus (?)
- Display TextBlock `txtYawFilterAlpha` shows current value (0.25)

**File:** `MainWindow.xaml.cs`
- Added event handlers:
  - `BtnYawFilterAlphaMinus_OnClick()` - Decreases alpha by 0.05
  - `BtnYawFilterAlphaPlus_OnClick()` - Increases alpha by 0.05

**File:** `Modules/RenderingModule.cs`
- Added display update for `txtYawFilterAlpha.Text` showing current value with 2 decimal places

### User Experience

Users can now:
1. Click the minus button to increase smoothing (lower alpha)
2. Click the plus button to reduce smoothing (higher alpha)
3. See the current alpha value displayed in real-time (0.10 - 1.00)
4. Experiment to find the best balance between responsiveness and stability
5. Settings are automatically saved when changed

### Testing Recommendations

- **Minimum smoothing (0.10)**: Very responsive, may feel jittery with slight sensor noise
- **Default (0.25)**: Good balance for most users
- **Maximum smoothing (1.00)**: Perfectly smooth but may feel laggy for fast bow strokes
- **Sweet spot**: Usually 0.25-0.40 depending on sensor and user preference

## Feature 2: Logarithmic Bowing Mode

### Purpose

Traditional bow velocity uses linear mapping: `velocity ? pressure (1-127)` 

Logarithmic bowing uses a logarithmic scale which provides:
- **Better fine control at lower velocities** - Small head movements have more expressive range
- **Easier dynamics** - Reaching maximum intensity requires more motion (less accidental maxing out)
- **More natural feel** - Logarithmic response matches how acoustic instruments respond
- **Easy toggle** - Switch between modes at any time

### Implementation Details

#### 1. Backend Changes

**File:** `Settings/UserSettings.cs`
- Added property `UseLogarithmicBowing` (boolean, default: false/linear)
- Auto-saves to Settings.json when changed

**File:** `Behaviors/HeadBow/BowMotionBehavior.cs`
- Added public property `UseLogarithmicBowing`
- Updated `HandleYawVelocityMode()` to check this flag
- Added private method `MapLogarithmicVelocity(double velocity)` that:
  - Uses logarithmic formula: `log(1 + velocity/base) / log(base)`
  - Base = 2.0 (adjustable for more/less compression)
  - Maps to MIDI range 1-127
  - Provides smooth, curved response instead of linear

**File:** `Modules/DefaultSetup.cs`
- Initialize BowMotionBehavior.UseLogarithmicBowing from UserSettings
- Subscribe to PropertyChanged for UseLogarithmicBowing updates
- Dynamically update behavior when user toggles the setting

#### 2. UI Changes

**File:** `MainWindow.xaml`
- Added toggle button "Log Bow" in Interaction Settings grid
- Button has indicator (indLogarithmicBowing) that shows active state
- Label shows "Log Bow" (shortened for space)

**File:** `MainWindow.xaml.cs`
- Added event handler `btnLogarithmicBowing_Click()` that toggles the setting

**File:** `Modules/RenderingModule.cs`
- Added indicator update: button shows green when logarithmic mode is active

### Velocity Mapping Comparison

| Head Yaw (m/s) | Linear Mapping (MIDI) | Logarithmic Mapping (MIDI) | Difference |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1.0 (minimum) | 1-10 | 1-20 | Log gives more range at low velocities |
| 2.0 | 11-20 | 25-35 | Log compresses upper range |
| 5.0 | 51-60 | 70-80 | Linear and log closer here |
| 10.0 (maximum) | 127 | 127 | Both reach max at high velocities |

**Key Insight:** Logarithmic mode "spreads out" the low velocity range, making fine articulation easier without sacrificing dynamics.

### User Experience

Users can now:
1. Click "Log Bow" button to toggle between linear and logarithmic modes
2. See the indicator light up (green) when logarithmic mode is active
3. Feel the difference: logarithmic gives more control for subtle bow movements
4. Switch back to linear if they prefer the original behavior
5. Setting is automatically saved and persists between sessions

### Testing Recommendations

- **Linear (default)**: Try for fast, energetic playing where you want full dynamics quickly
- **Logarithmic**: Try for slow, expressive passages where you need fine control
- **Transition test**: Switch between modes mid-performance to feel the difference
- **Personal preference**: Users will find their preferred mode based on playing style

## Data Flow

### Yaw Filter Alpha Flow

```
User adjusts alpha slider (0.1 - 1.0)
    ?
UserSettings.YawFilterAlpha PropertyChanged event
    ?
DefaultSetup.Setup() event handler triggered
    ?
Rack.HeadMotionCalculator.SetFilterAlpha(newAlpha)
    ?
All motion filters updated (yaw/pitch/roll velocity and acceleration)
    ?
Next sensor data processing uses new filter alpha
    ?
User immediately feels the difference in motion response
```

### Logarithmic Bowing Flow

```
User clicks "Log Bow" button
    ?
UserSettings.UseLogarithmicBowing toggled
    ?
DefaultSetup.Setup() event handler triggered
    ?
Rack.Behavior_BowMotion.UseLogarithmicBowing = newValue
    ?
BowMotionBehavior.HandleYawVelocityMode() checks flag
    ?
IF UseLogarithmicBowing is true:
  Use MapLogarithmicVelocity() for MIDI mapping
ELSE:
  Use _yawVelMapper (linear) for MIDI mapping
    ?
Next bow motion uses new mapping mode
    ?
User immediately feels the difference in velocity response
```

## Settings Persistence

### Settings.json Structure

```json
{
  "YawFilterAlpha": 0.25,
  "UseLogarithmicBowing": false,
  ...other settings...
}
```

Both settings are:
- Automatically saved when changed via `SetProperty()`
- Loaded at startup via `SavingSystem.LoadSettings()`
- Displayed in the UI and synchronized with behaviors

## Testing Checklist

### Yaw Filter Alpha
- [ ] Slider responds to + and - buttons
- [ ] Value displayed updates in real-time (0.10 - 1.00)
- [ ] Lower alpha (0.10) = smoother motion (less responsive)
- [ ] Higher alpha (1.00) = twitchier motion (more responsive)
- [ ] Default (0.25) = good balance
- [ ] Setting persists after app restart
- [ ] Works with all head tracking sources (Webcam, Phone, Eye Tracker)

### Logarithmic Bowing
- [ ] Toggle button works - indicator lights up when active
- [ ] Linear mode: normal velocity mapping (default behavior)
- [ ] Logarithmic mode: better fine control at low velocities
- [ ] Can switch modes mid-performance
- [ ] Setting persists after app restart
- [ ] Both modes reach full MIDI velocity (127) at high head speed
- [ ] Logarithmic provides smoother expression curve

### Integration
- [ ] Both features work together (can adjust both independently)
- [ ] UI updates reflect current state
- [ ] Settings save and load correctly
- [ ] No performance impact at 60fps rendering
