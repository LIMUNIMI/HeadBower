# Mouth Gate Multi-Source Support - Final Fix

## Problem
Mouth gate feature only worked when Webcam was selected as head tracking source. When Phone or Eye Tracker was selected, the mouth gate stopped working even though the webcam was still connected and sending mouth_ape data.

Additionally, excessive console logging was showing "WARNING: No mouth_ape data from sensor='NITHeyetrackerWrapper'" errors, which were confusing and incorrect.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Data Flow Architecture
In the unified architecture, ALL behaviors receive ALL data packets from ALL connected sensors:

```
Webcam ? UDPreceiverWebcam ? NithModuleUnified ? ParameterSelector ? ALL Behaviors
Phone  ? UDPreceiverPhone   ? NithModuleUnified ? ParameterSelector ? ALL Behaviors
EyeTracker ? UDPreceiverEyeTracker ? NithModuleUnified ? ParameterSelector ? ALL Behaviors
```

Each sensor sends **separate data packets** with its own `SensorName`:
- Webcam: `SensorName = "NITHwebcamWrapper"` with parameters: mouth_ape, eyeLeft_ape, eyeRight_ape, head_pos_*, etc.
- Phone: `SensorName = "NITHphoneWrapper"` with parameters: head_acc_*, head_pos_pitch, etc.
- Eye Tracker: `SensorName = "NITHeyetrackerWrapper"` with parameters: gaze_x, gaze_y, head_pos_*, etc.

### The Issue
The ParameterSelector was configured to whitelist mouth_ape ONLY when Webcam was selected as head tracking source. When other sources were selected, the webcam's mouth_ape data was being blocked.

### Secondary Issue - Excessive Logging
The debug logging added to MouthClosedNotePreventionBehavior was logging a warning for EVERY packet that didn't contain mouth_ape. This meant:
- When Eye Tracker was selected, both Eye Tracker AND Webcam packets arrived
- Eye Tracker packets don't have mouth_ape (normal!)
- The behavior logged "WARNING: No mouth_ape" for every Eye Tracker packet
- This flooded the console with false warnings

## Solution

### 1. Parameter Selector Configuration (MappingModule.cs)
Simplified the `SelectHeadTrackingSource` method to **always whitelist mouth parameters from webcam**, regardless of selected head tracking source:

```csharp
public static void SelectHeadTrackingSource(HeadTrackingSources source)
{
    // Clear all existing rules
    Rack.ParameterSelector.ClearAllRules();

    // Get the sensor name for this source
    string selectedSensorName = GetSensorNameForSource(source);

    // Whitelist all head motion parameters for the selected source
    Rack.ParameterSelector.AddRulesList(selectedSensorName, AllHeadMotionParameters);

    // CRITICAL: Whitelist mouth parameters from WEBCAM ONLY
    // The webcam is the ONLY source that sends mouth_ape, eyeLeft_ape, eyeRight_ape
    // These must ALWAYS be whitelisted regardless of selected head tracking source
    // This ensures mouth gate, modulation control, and bow pressure control work with all head tracking sources
    
    Rack.ParameterSelector.AddRule("NITHwebcamWrapper", NithParameters.mouth_ape);
    Rack.ParameterSelector.AddRule("NITHwebcamWrapper", NithParameters.eyeLeft_ape);
    Rack.ParameterSelector.AddRule("NITHwebcamWrapper", NithParameters.eyeRight_ape);
    
    // ALWAYS whitelist gaze from eye tracker (needed for gaze-to-mouse control)
    Rack.ParameterSelector.AddRule("NITHeyetrackerWrapper", NithParameters.gaze_x);
    Rack.ParameterSelector.AddRule("NITHeyetrackerWrapper", NithParameters.gaze_y);

    // Log configuration
    LogSelectionConfiguration(source);
}
```

**Key changes:**
- ? Removed redundant whitelisting of mouth_ape from Phone/Eye Tracker (they don't send it anyway)
- ? Kept only webcam mouth parameter whitelisting (source of truth)
- ? Added clear comments explaining the multi-source independence

### 2. Behavior Logging Cleanup (MouthClosedNotePreventionBehavior.cs)
Removed all debug logging and simplified the behavior:

```csharp
public void HandleData(NithSensorData nithData)
{
    // Check if feature is enabled
    if (Rack.UserSettings.MouthClosedNotePreventionMode != _MouthClosedNotePreventionModes.On)
    {
        // Feature disabled - open the gate (allow all note activation)
        Rack.MappingModule.IsMouthGateBlocking = false;
        return;
    }

    // ONLY process if mouth_ape parameter is present
    if (nithData.ContainsParameters(requiredParams))
    {
        // Get mouth aperture value and apply hysteresis logic
        var mouthApeValue = nithData.GetParameterValue(NithParameters.mouth_ape);
        double mouthAperture = mouthApeValue.Value.ValueAsDouble;

        // Update gate state based on hysteresis thresholds
        // ... (existing logic)
    }
    else
    {
        // If parameters missing from THIS packet, just ignore it
        // This is normal - not all sensors send mouth_ape (only webcam does)
        // The gate will remain in its current state until webcam data arrives
    }
}
```

**Key changes:**
- ? Removed excessive warning logs for packets without mouth_ape
- ? Silently ignore packets from sensors that don't provide mouth data
- ? Clean, minimal code focused on core functionality

## How It Works Now

### Multi-Source Independence
Different sensors can now work simultaneously and independently:

| Feature | Webcam | Phone | Eye Tracker |
|---------|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Head Motion** | Selected source | Selected source | Selected source |
| **Mouth Gate** | ? Always active | ? Always active | ? Always active |
| **Modulation (Mouth)** | ? Always active | ? Always active | ? Always active |
| **Bow Pressure (Mouth)** | ? Always active | ? Always active | ? Always active |
| **Gaze Control** | ? | ? | ? Always active |

### Example Scenario: Phone Head Tracking + Webcam Mouth Gate

```
User Configuration:
  - Head Tracking Source: Phone
  - Mouth Gate: Enabled
  - Webcam: Connected and running

Data Flow:
  1. Phone sends packet: SensorName="NITHphoneWrapper", params=[head_acc_yaw, head_pos_pitch, ...]
     ? ParameterSelector: ? Accept (whitelisted for Phone)
     ? MouthClosedNotePreventionBehavior: No mouth_ape ? Ignore packet
     ? BowMotionBehavior: Use head motion data ? Update bow position

  2. Webcam sends packet: SensorName="NITHwebcamWrapper", params=[mouth_ape, eyeLeft_ape, ...]
     ? ParameterSelector: ? Accept (mouth params always whitelisted)
     ? MouthClosedNotePreventionBehavior: Has mouth_ape ? Update gate state
     ? BowMotionBehavior: No head motion data (webcam not selected) ? Ignore packet

Result: 
  ? Phone provides head motion for bow control
  ? Webcam provides mouth aperture for gate control
  ? Both work simultaneously and independently
  ? No console spam or warnings
```

## Testing Verification

### Test Matrix

| Head Source | Webcam Connected | Mouth Gate | Expected Result |
|-------------|------------------|------------|-----------------|
| Webcam | ? | Enabled | ? Gate works, head motion works |
| Phone | ? | Enabled | ? Gate works, head motion works |
| Eye Tracker | ? | Enabled | ? Gate works, head motion works |
| Phone | ? | Enabled | ? Gate opens (failsafe), head motion works |
| Eye Tracker | ? | Enabled | ? Gate opens (failsafe), head motion works |

### Console Output Expectations

**When switching to Phone (with webcam connected):**
```
=== HEAD TRACKING SOURCE SELECTION ===
Selected Source: Phone
NithPreprocessor_ParameterSelector (Mode: Whitelist)
  NITHphoneWrapper: Accept 9 parameter(s): head_pos_yaw, head_pos_pitch, head_pos_roll, head_vel_yaw, head_vel_pitch, head_vel_roll, head_acc_yaw, head_acc_pitch, head_acc_roll
  NITHwebcamWrapper: Accept 3 parameter(s): mouth_ape, eyeLeft_ape, eyeRight_ape
  NITHeyetrackerWrapper: Accept 2 parameter(s): gaze_x, gaze_y
=====================================
```

**During operation:**
- ? NO warnings about missing mouth_ape from other sensors
- ? NO console spam
- ? Clean operation with all features working

## Benefits

### 1. True Multi-Source Operation
Users can now mix and match sensors for optimal performance:
- **Phone**: Best for smooth, precise head motion (IMU sensors)
- **Webcam**: Best for facial features and mouth gate
- **Eye Tracker**: Best for gaze control and head position

### 2. Cleaner Console Output
No more false warnings or console spam from normal multi-sensor operation.

### 3. Robust Failsafe
If webcam is disconnected or mouth data is unavailable:
- Gate automatically opens (doesn't block notes)
- No crashes or errors
- Seamless degradation to basic operation

### 4. Simpler Code
Removed unnecessary complexity:
- No redundant parameter whitelisting
- No excessive logging
- Clear, focused behavior implementation

## Technical Notes

### Why Not Merge Data Packets?
We could theoretically merge data from multiple sensors into a single packet, but this would:
- ? Increase complexity significantly
- ? Require timestamp synchronization
- ? Create coupling between sensors
- ? Make debugging harder

The current approach (separate packets per sensor) is:
- ? Simpler and more robust
- ? Allows sensors to run at different rates
- ? Easy to debug (each sensor's data is isolated)
- ? Behaviors naturally filter to their needed parameters

### Parameter Selector Whitelist Mode
The ParameterSelector runs in **Whitelist mode**, meaning:
- Only explicitly whitelisted parameters pass through
- All other parameters are dropped
- Each sensor can have different whitelisted parameters

This allows precise control over which data from which sensor is used for what purpose.

## Summary

? **Mouth gate now works with ALL head tracking sources**  
? **No configuration needed - works automatically**  
? **Clean console output - no false warnings**  
? **Robust failsafe behavior**  
? **True multi-source independence**

The mouth gate feature is now truly independent of head tracking source selection, allowing users to leverage the best features of each sensor simultaneously.
