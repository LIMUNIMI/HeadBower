# Try-Catch Protection Update - Pipeline Crash Prevention

## Overview

Added comprehensive try-catch protection to all behaviors in the sensor processing pipeline to prevent crashes when unexpected errors occur during data processing.

## Problem

Behaviors were crashing the entire interaction pipeline when:
- Required parameters were unexpectedly missing
- Null reference exceptions occurred during startup
- Sensor data became corrupted or invalid
- Filters or mappers encountered unexpected values

## Solution

Wrapped all `HandleData` methods in try-catch blocks with:
1. **Exception logging** - Output detailed error information for debugging
2. **Graceful degradation** - Set safe default values on error
3. **Pipeline continuity** - Don't crash, just log and continue

## Files Updated

### 1. **BowMotionBehavior.cs** ?
- Already had parameter validation
- Added in previous fix

### 2. **ModulationControlBehavior.cs** ?
- Added try-catch around entire HandleData
- Logs exceptions with stack trace
- Sets modulation to 0 on error

### 3. **BowPressureControlBehavior.cs** ?
- Already had try-catch from previous fix
- Logs exceptions with stack trace
- Sets bow pressure to 0 on error

### 4. **HapticFeedbackBehavior.cs** ?
- Added try-catch around entire HandleData
- Logs exceptions with stack trace
- Silent failure (vibration is non-critical)

### 5. **MouthClosedNotePreventionBehavior.cs** ?
- Added try-catch around entire HandleData
- Logs exceptions with stack trace
- Opens gate on error (fail-safe: allow notes)

### 6. **VisualFeedbackBehavior.cs** ?
- Added try-catch around entire HandleData
- Logs exceptions with stack trace
- Silent failure (visual feedback is non-critical)

### 7. **NithSensorBehavior_GazeToMouse.cs** ?
- Added try-catch around entire HandleData
- Logs exceptions
- Silent failure (gaze control is non-critical)

## Pattern Used

```csharp
public void HandleData(NithSensorData nithData)
{
    try
    {
        // Early exit checks (feature disabled, etc.)
        if (!enabled)
        {
            ResetState();
            return;
        }

        // Parameter validation
        if (!nithData.ContainsParameters(requiredParams))
        {
            return; // OR set safe defaults
        }

        // Main processing logic
        ProcessData(nithData);
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        // Log exception for debugging
        Console.WriteLine($"BehaviorName Exception: {ex.Message}");
        Console.WriteLine($"StackTrace: {ex.StackTrace}");
        
        // Set safe defaults
        try { ResetStateToSafe(); } catch { }
    }
}
```

## Safety Strategy

### Critical Behaviors (Musical State)
**BowMotionBehavior, BowPressureControlBehavior, ModulationControlBehavior**
- Set musical output to safe state (0, off, etc.)
- Log detailed error information
- Allow pipeline to continue

### Non-Critical Behaviors (Feedback)
**HapticFeedbackBehavior, VisualFeedbackBehavior, GazeToMouse**
- Log error but don't spam console
- Simply skip the update
- No state reset needed

### Gate Behaviors (Safety)
**MouthClosedNotePreventionBehavior**
- Fail open (allow notes) rather than fail closed (block notes)
- This prevents the behavior from permanently blocking music on error

## Benefits

1. **Pipeline Stability**: No single behavior can crash the entire sensor pipeline
2. **Debuggability**: Detailed error logs help identify root cause
3. **Graceful Degradation**: System continues working even with sensor issues
4. **User Experience**: App doesn't freeze or crash on temporary sensor glitches

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Disconnect sensors during operation** - should log errors but not crash
2. **Switch between sensor sources rapidly** - should handle missing parameters
3. **Monitor console output** - look for recurring exceptions
4. **Check musical output** - should reset to safe state on errors

## Future Improvements

Consider adding:
- Error counters (track how many errors per behavior)
- Automatic behavior disable after N consecutive errors
- Recovery strategies (reconnect sensors, reset filters, etc.)
- Error reporting to UI (show warning indicators)

## Notes

- All behaviors now follow the same defensive programming pattern
- Parameter validation happens BEFORE try-catch (fail fast on missing data)
- Try-catch protects against unexpected runtime errors
- Each behavior has appropriate fail-safe behavior for its purpose
